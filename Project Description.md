<h2>üìã Overview</h2>
<p>Welcome to the Real-Time Smoking Detection System! This innovative project leverages computer vision and machine learning to detect smoking behavior by analyzing the proximity of the <strong>hand</strong> to the <strong>face</strong> in real-time. The system combines <strong>OpenCV</strong>, <strong>CVZone</strong>, and <strong>TensorFlow</strong> to create a robust and efficient solution for smoking detection.</p>

<h2>üö¨ YOLOv5-Based Cigarette Detection</h2>
<p>In addition to the main project, I also worked on a cigarette detection system using YOLOv5.</p>

<h3>Why YOLOv5?</h3>
<p>YOLOv5 uses a deep convolutional neural network to detect objects in images or videos. It can detect objects of different sizes and aspect ratios with high accuracy and speed. YOLOv5 achieves this by using a single-stage detection framework that simultaneously predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities for each object.</p>
<p>One of the key features of YOLOv5 is its architecture, which is based on a smaller and more efficient backbone network called CSPDarknet. This results in faster training and inference times compared to other state-of-the-art object detection models.</p>
<p>Another advantage of YOLOv5 is its flexibility and ease of use. It comes with a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to easily train and deploy their own object detection models. Additionally, it is compatible with multiple deep learning frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and ONNX.</p>

<h3>The Dataset</h3>
<p>The dataset for this task was obtained from Kaggle, as this particular problem largely involves privacy matters and concerns. While the goal was to obtain data from real-world scenarios, the dataset provides representation close to that of actual samples, with the target object, a cigarette, appearing at many different scales and sizes.</p>

<p>The split used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Training: 1400 images</li>
    <li>Validation: 300 images</li>
    <li>Testing: 296 images</li>
</ul>
<p>The images were annotated in the YOLO format (.txt) using labelimg.</p>

<h3>The The Model</h3>
<p>YOLOv5s is the smallest and fastest variant of the YOLOv5 family, which makes it suitable for real-time applications on low-end devices.</p>
<p>The YOLOv5s model consists of a total of 87 layers, including 83 convolutional layers and 4 pooling layers. The model has a total of 7.6 million parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of the layer types and parameters in YOLOv5s:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Convolutional layers: 83</li>
    <li>Pooling layers: 4</li>
    <li>Batch normalization layers: 84</li>
    <li>Activation layers: 83</li>
    <li>Linear layers: 3</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The number of parameters in each type of layer is as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Convolutional layers: 7.4 million</li>
    <li>Batch normalization layers: 166,656</li>
    <li>Linear layers: 40,864</li>
</ul>
<p>The total number of parameters in the YOLOv5s model is therefore 7.6 million.</p>

<h3>Experimentations</h3>
<p>The model was trained using the ultralytics implementation of YOLOv5, which makes it easier to train and deploy these models. Using the available training setup, a total of 4 (Major and few minor ones, with small changes) models were tested. (Note that the image size used was 512x512)</p>
<p><strong>They are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Model 1:</strong> First model, therefore the Baseline for this task. With standard setup, it was trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 16.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> It performed poorly, with a precision of 0.75542 and mAP@0.5 of 0.6785.</li>
    <li><strong>Model 2:</strong> For this run, the number of epochs was raised to 25 with batch size of 32, to give the model more examples at a time.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> It showed significant improvement, with a precision of 0.86214 and mAP@0.5 of 0.8467, but still failed to properly work while testing.</li>
    <li><strong>Model 3:</strong> Increase in epochs was a definite improvement, and so was the raise in batch size. Therefore, with the same setup, this model was trained for 50 epochs.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> It improved even further, with a precision of 0.9434 and mAP@0.5 of 0.93828, and also worked well with testing. But some other objects were also getting misclassified as a 'cigarette', this model still needed to learn more.</li>
    <li><strong>Model 4:</strong> The final run, with 100 epochs and batch size of 32.</li>
    <li><strong>Result:</strong> A lot of the issues with earlier models were addressed with this one. There were certainly some misclassifications but overall it worked best. Precision: 0.9729 and mAP@0.5: 0.9714.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Deployment</h3>
<p>The best model weights were obtained from the training process, and the inference engine was deployed on a web application using the Django backend framework with a simple UI.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages of Django:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Highly scalable</li>
    <li>Secure</li>
    <li>Built-in Authentication</li>
    <li>Built-in ORM system</li>
    <li>Simple to integrate with frontend templates</li>
</ul>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Upload Samples (Images/Videos) and store them in the database</li>
    <li>Supports real-time detections using RTSP links for CCTV footage</li>
    <li>View Samples</li>
    <li>Run Model Inferences</li>
</ul>
